## Hi there :wave:

We're AnalogIO. We convert hot coffee into cool stuff for Cafe Analog :fire::coffee: 

AnalogIO is a group of volunteer software students, supporting the student organization Cafe Analog at the IT University of Copenhagen. 
We create and maintain backend systems, apps and websites for both customers and baristas of Cafe Analog.
